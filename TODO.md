# TODO

P.S. stuff doesn't have to be organized as it is made, it just has to be done later (or at least noted)
# use modern opengl (i.e. shaders, GLSL)
  please! it can be messy as long as it works!
# move the "ship"
  without weird circular motions (perpendicular to axes)
# finish math functions
  vec3,mat4,etc
# make a better looking ship
  instead of a cube
# organize the layout
  have an entity struct



# camera following ship
  idea - camera offset rotation is the rotation velocity of the ship
