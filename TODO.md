# TODO
P.S. stuff doesn't have to be organized as it is made, it just has to be done later (or at least noted)
P.P.S. it is ok to make new files, it is better to have many small files that do individual tasks than one big file that does everything (it means less headache)
# use modern opengl (i.e. shaders, GLSL)
  please! it can be messy as long as it works!
# a more powerful makefile
  cross platform
# move the "ship"
  without weird circular motions (perpendicular to axes)
# finish math functions
  vec3,mat4,etc
# organize the layout
  have an entity struct
# camera following ship
  idea - camera offset rotation is the rotation velocity of the ship
# research shattering asteroids
  Voronoi fractures
